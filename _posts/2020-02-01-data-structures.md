#### Gitlet - version control system

The aim of this project was to better understand the functionality of Git and the persistence of files by programming and mimicking git's functionality myself. By understanding the main data structure behind commits and git in general, gitlet was able to replicate the functions of Git - ranging from pushing, pulling, committing and adding remotes. I wrote the program in Java and had 7 classes with over 5,000 lines of code. 

#### Enigma

This project, also written in Java, is an attempt to create a programmatic replica of the [Enigma Machines][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine] from WWII. The final program was able to encode and decode messages based on the rules of the original creator. The process was more difficult than I had thought because of the different permutations that were possible in the machine and the multiple rules added during the war to make decoding messages difficult. 

#### Lines Of Action

Taking inspiration from [this][http://www.boardspace.net/loa/english/index.html] board game, Lines of Action was my first interaction with AI, heuristics and GUI use. I was able to code a working rendition of the LOA game, built in with rules and message boards that inform you when a move is invalid. Furthermore, I had used Alpha-Beta Pruning and heuristic functions to create an AI player. Although the AI did not win every game, it searched moves to a depth of 8 and was usually able to predict and play obvious wins.
