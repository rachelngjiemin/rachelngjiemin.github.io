#### COVID-19 response social modeling

Carried out an ML project using John Hopkins university data, [StreetLight][https://www.streetlightdata.com/] data as well as demographic data to better understand which factor had the biggest impact on COVID infection rate at a per county level in the US. Utilized various Ensemble and regression techniques to understand the impact of pre-determined societal structure on the effectiveness of safe distancing measures.
