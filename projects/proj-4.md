<h4 style="color:#000000">  <a href = 'https://www.sagementors.org/' > Sage Mentorship Project </a> </h4>

<em> The Sage Mentorship Project is UC Berkeley's largest one-on-one mentorship organization, matching hundreds of committed UC Berkeley students to an elementary school-aged mentee each year. Our mission is to provide youth from the twelve Berkeley and Oakland elementary schools we reach with a personal connection to mentors through academic and extracurricular activities in order to foster life skills and personal growth. </em>

<br>
Over 4 semesters, I mentored 2 students - one in the 3rd and the other in the 4th grade. I mentored for 2 hours a week, with an additional hour in class discussing child psychology and mentoring strategies. 

The ultimate goal of Sage's mentorship was to enable students to see their own potential and future. My weekly vists was always a breath of fresh air from the hustle of college. After the first semster, my mentees had gotten more comfotable with me and hence shared excitedly and often about their futures and what they wanted to achieve. Their dreams changed rapidly from a comic book writer to a superhero, they were excited by possibilities and imagined for themselves a world where they did good.
