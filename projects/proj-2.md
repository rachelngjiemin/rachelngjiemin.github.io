As part of course work, we are often required to complete rigorous projects that span several weeks or months. Click on the links below to find out more about projects I have completed for course work at UC Berkeley. 
<br>
The data structures project were completed for <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/CS61B/">CS61B</a>: Data Structures.

<br>
<br>

Both the Covid projects and data science projects were completed for a combination of two data science courses: 

<li> <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/education/courses/data-8">Data8</a>: The Foundations of Data Science </li>
<li> <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/education/courses/data-100">Data100</a>: Principles and Techniques of Data Science </li>
