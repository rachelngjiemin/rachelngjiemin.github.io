As part of course work, we are often required to complete rigorous projects that span several weeks or months. Click on the links below to find out more about projects I have completed for course work at UC Berkeley. The data structures project were completed for [CS61B](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/CS61B/): Data Structures.

Both the Covid projects and data science projects were completed for a combination of two data science courses: 

* [Data8](https://data.berkeley.edu/education/courses/data-8): The Foundations of Data Science
* [Data100](https://data.berkeley.edu/education/courses/data-100): Principles and Techniques of Data Science
